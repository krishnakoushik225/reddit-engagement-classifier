# reddit-engagement-classifier
This project analyzes Reddit posts to predict engagement trends â€” classifying whether a post will receive high (Up), low (Down), or moderate (Stable) user interaction. We use metadata like Tags, Domain, and Subreddit from a Kaggle dataset and apply Sentence-BERT embeddings combined with structured features like comment counts.
